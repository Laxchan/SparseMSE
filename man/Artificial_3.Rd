\title{Artificial data set to demonstrate possible instabilities}
\format{
An object of class \code{data.frame} with 4 rows and 4 columns.

\usage{
Artificial_3

\description{
This is a simple data set based on three lists, which gives examples of models that
 fail on one or the other of the criteria tested by \code{\link{checkident}}. This is Table 2 in Chan, Silverman and Vincent (2021).
}
\details{
If all three two-list effects are included in the fitted model then the linear program
in \code{\link{checkident}} yields a strictly positive value but the matrix A is not of full column rank, so the parameters are not identifiable.
If the model contains AB either alone or in conjunction with one of AC and BC, then the linear program result is zero, so the MLE does not exist.
If only main effects are considered, or if either or both of AC and BC, but not AB are included,
then the model passes both tests.
