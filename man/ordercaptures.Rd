\title{Order capture histories}
\usage{
ordercaptures(zmat)
}
\arguments{
\item{zmat}{Data matrix with \eqn{t} columns. The \eqn{t} columns, each corresponding to a particular list,
are 0s and 1s defining the capture histories observed. Where a capture history is not explicitly listed,
it is assumed that it has observed count zero.}
}
\value{
A data matrix that is ordered first by the number of 1s in the capture history
and then lexicographically by columns.
}
\description{
Given a matrix with capture histories only, the routine orders the capture histories first by the number of
1s in the capture history and then lexicographically by columns.
}
\examples{
#UK 5 list data
data(UKdat_5)
# Obtain matrix with capture histories only
UKdat_5_cap <- UKdat_5[, 1:dim(UKdat_5)[2]-1]
ordercaptures(UKdat_5_cap)
