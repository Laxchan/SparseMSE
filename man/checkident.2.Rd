\title{Carry out the Fienberg-Rinaldo procedure on an array of data vectors and a vector of models}
\usage{
checkident.2(x, xcap, zmods)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a matrix of data observations for a common capture matrix}

\item{xcap}{the incidence matrix of the capture histories corresponding to the rows of x}

\item{zmods}{a vector of models}
}
\value{
a matrix with rows corresponding to the models and columns to the columns of x, with elements
taking the value T if the FR linear program for a vector of 0s and 1s with the same zero pattern as the x data yields a strictly
positive value
}
\description{
Suppose we have a collection of different data outcomes on the same set of capture histories and a vector of models.
Typically the data outcomes will be bootstrap replications. This routine finds the unique support patterns among the data
and hence economises the task of finding which model/data combinations satisfy the Fienberg-Rinaldo condition
}
\examples{
data(Korea)
z=sortmodelsbic(Korea)
z=bootstrapcal(z)
n2=dim(z$xdata)[2]
