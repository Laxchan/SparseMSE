\title{Given a vector of captures, find those which are not in the vector but all of whose parents are}
\usage{
boundary_captures(kcap, nlists)
}
\arguments{
\item{kcap}{An encoded capture history that corresponds to the row number of the capture history data set}

\item{nlists}{The total number of lists}
}
\value{
a vector giving the encoded versions of the descendants
}
\description{
Call the resulting set the "boundary".  Supposing that the current set of captures is a hierarchical model, that property
will be preserved if a capture in the boundary is added to it. The routine is called internally by \code{find_neighbour_hierarchies}.
}
\examples{
modelstr = "[12,23]"
nlists=4
zhierroots = convert_from_hierarchy(modelstr, F)
zhier = unique(ancestors(zhierroots, nlists))
boundary_captures(zhier,nlists)
