\title{Given a vector of captures, find those which are not in the vector but all of whose parents are}
\usage{
boundary_captures(kcap, nlists)
}
\arguments{
\item{kcap}{An encoded capture history}

\item{nlists}{The total number of lists}
}
\value{
a vector giving the encoded versions of the descendants
}
\description{
Call the resulting set the "boundary".  Supposing that the current set of captures is a hierarchical model, that property
will be preserved if a capture in the boundary is added to it. The routine is called internally by \code{find_neighbour_hierarchies}.
