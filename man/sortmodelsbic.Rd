\title{Models BICS, abundance and maxorder.}
\usage{
sortmodelsbic(
  xdata,
  maxorder = dim(xdata)[2] - 2,
  checkexist = T,
  removeFRfail = T,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{xdata}{The original data matrix with capture histories and counts.}

\item{maxorder}{Maximum order of models to be included}

\item{checkexist}{If T then the Fienberg-Rinaldo condition is checked for each model}

\item{removeFRfail}{If checkexist is T then models which fail the FR condition are removed from the results}

\item{...}{Parameters to be fed to \code{gethiermodels}.}
}
\value{
A list with the following components
\describe{
\item{res}{A matrix with the models considered, their abundance, BIC and their order, sorted
 into increasing order of BIC}
  \item{xdata}{The original data matrix with capture histories and counts.}
  \item{maxorder}{Order parameter that was feed into \code{gethiermodels}}
  }
}
\description{
This routine sorts the models in increasing order according to their BICs, returns the sorted models with their
corresponding BICs and abundance. The original data as well as the maxorder of the models
considered are returned as well.
